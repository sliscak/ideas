1. ### Use chatGPT for crime solving (as a detective or helper)? You would provide a description of the current state(scene) to chatGPT and chatGPT would guide your search on the crime scene by giving you hints where to look for footprints, clues, etc. By telling chatGPT more about what you found and where chatGPT would help you with infering what happened.
2. ### Use chatGPT as a tutor. chatGPT can explain complex concepts in simple sentences and it can also summarize and explain research papers and other long texts.
3. ### chatGPT could be used as a strategist that controls game npc's.
4. ### Use chatGPT to design better AI chatbots, you give a description of requirements for the AI chatbot and chatGPT gives you a high level description of how such a system could work. It even can compile a list of task you need to accomplish the goal. When using prompt engineering, when you ask for code, chatGPT can give you python and pytorch code for the modules or a whole (machine learning) pipeline. chatGPT can also explain its weaknesses and suggest improvements!
