1. #### Make an Gradio app that would turn voice(speech recording) into an image using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)<br /> The gradio app would record the voice(speech) of the user(the user would describe the image using his voice), feed it into the Whisper model, the Whisper model would convert the voice into text and then the text would be feed into the stable-diffusion model which would make an image from the text input.)<br /> An user would generate an image using the app by describing the image using his voice.
