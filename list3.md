1.  Build a game where the game rules(that are written in english) are translated with OpenAI Codex into code and executed. GPT-3 would generate the backstory and attributes of entities and game rules and codex would translate the rules into functions which the game engine would execute. The game rules would be either hard coded, or written by users/players, or generated by GPT-3 (or later model). Like i said, Codex would take those rules written in natural language(mostly english) and translate those into code (like lua or python or gdscript) and the code would be later executed/interpreted by the game engine for example Unreal Engine or Godot, unless the game is a MMO and running on a server, then the server would execute/interpret the code.
2.  A game editor or world builder that would take commands in natural language and using GPT-3 and Codex translate the commands into code that would be executed/interpreted by the game engine or server. You would write that the 3D ship (or other entity) on the 2D or 3D game map needs to be on the land instead of the sea and Codex would generate the code that would have the function to relocate the 3D ship on the map to be on the land. Or game editor or world builder would spawn a entity near another enty. Like spawn a person near a car. 
3.  Use GPT-3 and Codex combined as a strategist, that would controll many NPCs (mostly at once) on a high level. That is it would tell a group(of a few, to as many as possible) of NPCs to attack at a certain point on the map or to fall back, or flank the enemy or do some other action depending on the situation on the map and/or from the game logs and/or other contextual clues.
