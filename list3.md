1.  Build a game where the game rules(that are written in english) are translated with OpenAI Codex into code and executed. GPT-3 would generate the backstory and attributes of entities and game rules and codex would translate the rules into functions which the game engine would execute. The game rules would be either hard coded, or written by users/players, or generated by GPT-3 (or later model). Like i said, Codex would take those rules written in natural language(mostly english) and translate those into code (like lua or python or gdscript) and the code would be later executed/interpreted by the game engine for example Unreal Engine or Godot, unless the game is a MMO and running on a server, then the server would execute/interpret the code.
